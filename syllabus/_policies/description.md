<b>From the Catalog:</b>

<b>Extended Description:</b> The courseâ€™s preferred methods will require students to create and
maintain extensive testing suites and other automated quality-assurance measures. Finally, students
will immerse themselves in some of the core values of the class: appropriately scoped features,
progressive enhancement, granular commits, semantic versioning, rigorous code reviews, automated
builds, continuous integration/continuous deployment, accurate code-adjacent documentation, and a
healthy suspicion and pessimistic view of frameworks, libraries, and other dependencies in
production.
