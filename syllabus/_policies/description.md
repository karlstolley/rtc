title: Course Description
---

<b>From the Catalog:</b> This course covers a set of protocols, architectures, and APIs designed to
enable browser-to-browser real-time communication of voice, video, and data. Students will learn to
apply basic technologies including WebSockets, HTTP, HTML5, Web Sockets, NAT, STUN, TURN, and ICE to
ensure two-way real-time communication is established using the WebRTC APIs and architectures.
Students will use JavaScript and development environments to create basic data and media
applications based on the WebRTC technologies and will record the impact of their applications on
the performance and behavior of the networks that carry them.

<b>Extended Description:</b> The courseâ€™s preferred development methods will require students to
create and maintain testing suites and other automated quality-assurance measures. Students will
also immerse themselves in some of the core values of the class: appropriately scoped features,
progressive enhancement, expertly crafted commits, semantic versioning, rigorous code reviews,
automated builds, continuous integration/continuous deployment, accurate code-adjacent
documentation, and a healthy suspicion and pessimistic view of frameworks, libraries, and other
dependencies in production.
