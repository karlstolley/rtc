title: Books

There are no books required for this course. The existing titles on WebRTC are several years old,
and do not reflect the complete contents of the
[WebRTC 1.0: Real-time Communication Between Browsers](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/) specification,
which reached Candidate Recommendation status in December 2019.

We will instead read widely from industry and academic sources, which are linked from the course
calendar.
