  <b>My policy for assigning books:</b> The only book required in this class is one that I am
  finishing writing. It will be available as a Beta eBook from Pragmatic Programmers soon. I am
  ethically opposed to profiting off of students in my classes, so please note that I will be
  donating all royalties I receive from sales to this class to the [Hawks4Hawks hardship
  fund](https://alumni.iit.edu/hawks4hawks).
