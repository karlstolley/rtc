This project will be a refinement of Project Two, making fuller use of STUN/TURN signaling for more
robust network interoperability and obviating the need for monkeying with firewalls, etc. Your app
will also include a simple user-login and user-persistence feature, which will be combined with the
Web Notifications API to allow users to notify other known users when they wish to use your app to
communicate and engage your appâ€™s shared task.
