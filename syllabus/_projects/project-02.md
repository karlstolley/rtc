For this project, we will work as a class-wide agency (including the instructor) spread across
multiple teams working on the creation and development of a remote-learning platform using WebRTC
APIs and other real-time technologies covered in this class.The goal by the end of the alpha cycle
will be to attempt to hold at least a portion of our weekly classes on the system weâ€™re building.

Full project description by October 1, after we discuss the idea as a class on Basecamp throughout
the month of September.
