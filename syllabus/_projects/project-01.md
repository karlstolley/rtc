For this project, you will work individually to build a small app that is powered by WebRTC.

**ITMD 469 students** will build an app that allows students to seek help from an instructor or TA
in real time, something like virtual office hours. The app must include both audio and video, and
make some worthwhile use of a data channel.

**ITMD 545 students** will build an app that includes some combination of streaming audio, video,
and data.
