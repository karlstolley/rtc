This project, required only of ITMD 545 students, will expose you to the academic research going on
in relation to WebRTC and related technologies. Each student will find a peer reviewed article from
ACM, IEEE, or another respected venue that publishes academic research in computing, and then write
and post to Basecamp a 250-word summary of the article.
