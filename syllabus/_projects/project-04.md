This project, required only of ITMD 545 students, will expose you to the academic research going on
in relation to WebRTC and related technologies. In consultation and collaboration with the
instructor, graduate students will work together to produce an annotated bibliography of WebRTC and
related-technology scholarship of roughly the last ten years.

Full project description by September 15.
